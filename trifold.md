## Mini AI's Core (The Brain)                                                                   ||| ## The Enabling Application (The Nervous System)                                                                                                                                                                ||| ## User Interaction and Integration (The Body)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Name Customization:** Users can give Mini AI a custom name.                                                                     ||| *   **Foreground Service:** Runs continuously in the background, ensuring the application is less likely to be terminated by the system.                                                              ||| *   **Bixby-Like Interaction:** Operates unobtrusively and responds to context, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Personality/Response Styles:** Mini AI can adopt different personalities or response styles based on user preference or context.  ||| *   **Communication Bridge:** Establishes a robust pathway for Mini AI to interact with the application, allowing for complex data exchange, permission requests, and contextual information. ||| *   **Voice-First:** Prioritizes voice input for user interaction, leveraging Android's `SpeechRecognizer` API.
*   **Contextual Understanding:**  Analyzes the current situation (user's activity, time of day, etc.) to provide relevant assistance.         ||| *   **Permission System:** Requests, manages, and enforces permissions, ensuring Mini AI can only access authorized resources. Mini AI's functions determine the permissions needed, and the application requests them.                                                                            ||| *   **Context Awareness:** Monitors user activity, foreground apps, time, and potentially location to tailor Mini AI's responses and actions.
*   **Command Processing:** Interprets user instructions and translates them into actions.                               ||| *   **Device Integration:** Utilizes Android's system APIs to access and control hardware, settings, and other applications.                                                                                       ||| *   **Proactive Assistance:**  Offers help and suggestions based on context and learned user preferences.
*   **Voice Recognition:** Converts spoken words into text for processing.                                                                 ||| *   **System APIs:**  Leverages Android's `DisplayManager`, `AudioRecord`, `SpeechRecognizer`, `PackageManager`, `Settings.System`, and other relevant classes to achieve deep system integration.         ||| *   **Guest User Mode Inspiration:** Employs isolated permissions, similar to Android's guest user mode, to control Mini AI's access to data and functionality, and can also be used for security and lock screen integration.
*   **Ghost Processing:**  Considers multiple possibilities simultaneously without committing to a specific course of action until necessary.  ||| *   **Display Mirror Control:** Manages the mirrored display using Android's `MediaProjection` API to provide a canvas for Mini AI's output.                                                              ||| *   **Wearables Inspiration**: We will be using the way that wearables interact with voice as inspiration for our interactions.
*   **`algColl`:** The algorithm collective that allows Mini AI to learn and adapt, dynamically updating and refining its knowledge.            ||| *   **Pop-up Window:** Presents Mini AI's output in an unobtrusive, floating window using Android's overlay capabilities.                                                                                            ||| *   **Facebook Messenger Inspiration:** Inspired by Messenger's multiple accounts, we have made it so that the user can customize Mini AI's name and personality.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The collection of `.txt` files that define Mini AI's capabilities, responses, and actions.                                         ||| *   **Minimized Operation:** Runs in the background as a foreground service with a minimal UI presence.                                                                                                ||| *   **Display Mirroring:** Outputs Mini AI's information onto the mirrored display.
*   **Learning:** Mini AI learns by updating algColl and through the addition of new `.txt` files in the knowledge base.                      ||| *   **Modularity**: The application is designed to be modular, so that it can be easily expanded.                                                                                             ||| *   **Pop-up Window:** Presents Mini AI's output in an unobtrusive, floating window using Android's overlay capabilities.
*   **Response Generation:** Creates text-based responses based on user input and the current context.                                       ||| *   **Processes:** The application must be in a separate process from Mini AI.                                                                                                ||| *   **Unobtrusive Operation:**  Prioritizes remaining out of the user's way, only surfacing when necessary, similar to how Bixby operates.
*   **`instr`:**  Defines Mini AI's behaviors and protocols.                                                                   ||| *   **Manifest:** The android manifest file will define what permissions are necessary.                                                                                              ||| *   **Context Management:** The app monitors and manages the current context to ensure that Mini AI is operating in the correct way.
* **Ghost Files**: Mini AI is able to use ghost files to load new functionalities.                                         ||| | || *   **Surface (Pop-Up):** When the user directly engages with Mini AI's interface, it's presented in the pop-up window. This is for focused interactions.
| || ||| * **Sub-Surface (Mirrored Display):** When Mini AI is operating in the background, it's using the mirrored display. This is for the unobtrusive, behind-the-scenes functionality.
| || ||| * **Multiple accounts**: The user can customize the name, and the personality of Mini AI.
| || ||| * **Developer options**: The developer options give inspiration on what APIs to use.
| || ||| * **Voice**: Mini AI will use voice as one of the primary inputs from the user.

## Build Process Review and Analysis
