INSTALLING THE ANDROID APP VERSION
================================

This is specifically for the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 app version.

1. DOWNLOAD:
   - Get the InnerMindOS.apk file
   - Save it to your Downloads folder

2. INSTALL:
   - Open Files app
   - Go to Downloads
   - Tap InnerMindOS.apk
   - If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources
   - Tap Install

3. LAUNCH:
   - Find "InnerMind OS" in your apps
   - Open it
   - Grant permissions when asked (storage, etc.)

The app will automatically:
- Detect your Fold 3's screen state (folded/unfolded)
- Load the AI system
- Start running

That's it - no terminals, no commands, just a regular Android app install.
